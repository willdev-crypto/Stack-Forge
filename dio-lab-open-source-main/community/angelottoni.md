# **Hi there! I'm Angelina Ottoni** :)

## **About me:**

I've always had a passion for nature, so it was no surprise that I pursued a degree in Biological Sciences.

During my studies, I discovered the fascinating world of fungi, and I fell in love with it.

This led me to pursue a Postgraduate degree, eventually becoming a Master and Doctor in [Biology of Fungi](https://www.ufpe.br/ppgbf).

Throughout my academic career, I've participated in various projects aimed at studying, delimiting, and preserving fungal diversity.

I've mainly collected specimens in the Amazon and Atlantic forests in Brazil, and have also been involved in extension projects teaching Mycology to students of all levels.

My Master's and Doctoral research focused on the systematic study of clavarioid fungi (Agaricomycetes) in Brazil.

I conducted the first comprehensive study of these fungi in our country, using both morphological and phylogenetic data to better understand their richness, geographic distribution and phylogenetic position.

During my research, I was introduced to Molecular Biology, one of the most promising tools of the century, which I quickly learned and applied to add value and precision to my results.

I also gained theoretical and practical experience in Scientific Methodology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Microbiology, with an emphasis on fungi.

Teaching science and biology in basic education has also been a valuable experience for me.

I've always had an interest in Data Analysis, which led me to start studying Python after my doctorate. I've since used this programming language to optimize and improve the analysis of my research results.

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher and a member of the [Laboratory of Basidiomycota](https://www.instagram.com/labb.ufpe/) research team and learning more about data analysis.
